Electricity Price Prediction using Scikit-Learn
-----------------------------------------------

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts electricity prices using the powerful Scikit-Learn library. The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and efficient model that can forecast electricity prices based on historical data.

### Project Overview
In this project, I have utilized a dataset consisting of historical electricity price data along with relevant features such as weather conditions, time of day, and market trends. By employing various machine learning techniques and utilizing Scikit-Learn's comprehensive set of tools, I have built a predictive model capable of estimating electricity prices with good accuracy.
